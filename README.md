# Spotify Trend Analysis with Tableau

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to utilize Tableau's data visualization capabilities to analyze and present insights from Spotify data. The goal is to transform raw Spotify data into meaningful and interactive visualizations, enabling users to gain insights, make data-driven decisions, and explore their music preferences in a visually engaging manner. As an analyst, the task is to provide recommendations for suggesting advertisements to stay competitive in the music industry.

### Approach

#### 1. Data Collection
Start by collecting Spotify data, including information about top tracks, playlists, and other relevant data.

#### 2. Data Preparation
Clean and prepare the data for analysis. Ensure structured format and necessary fields for visualization goals.


#### 3. Explore and Visualize Data
Explore Spotify data in Tableau, using its drag-and-drop interface. Select fields, choose chart types, and customize visualizations.

#### 4. Create Dashboards
Combine multiple visualizations into interactive dashboards. Present multiple insights in a single view, telling a comprehensive story with Spotify data.

#### 5. Interactivity and Filters
Leverage Tableau's interactivity features. Add filters, drill-down options, and other interactive elements to enhance user experience.

#### 6. Publish and Share
Once satisfied with visualizations and dashboards, publish to Tableau Server or Tableau Public. Share insights, embed visualizations, or collaborate with teammates.
