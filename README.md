# Spotify Trend Analysis with Tableau

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to utilize Tableau's data visualization capabilities to analyze and present insights from Spotify data. The goal is to transform raw Spotify data into meaningful and interactive visualizations, enabling users to gain insights, make data-driven decisions, and explore their music preferences in a visually engaging manner. As an analyst, the task is to provide recommendations for suggesting advertisements to stay competitive in the music industry.

### Approach

#### 1. Data Collection
- Initiate the project by collecting Spotify data. This should encompass a comprehensive range of information, such as details about top tracks, playlists, and other pertinent data.

#### 2. Data Preparation
- Prepare the collected data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data to ensure a structured format and validating that it contains the necessary fields required for achieving the visualization goals.


#### 3. Explore and Visualize Data
-  Utilize Tableau's powerful features to explore the Spotify data. This involves leveraging the drag-and-drop interface to select relevant fields, choose appropriate chart types, and customize visualizations according to the project's requirements.

#### 4. Create Dashboards
- Aggregate the insights gained from the Spotify data by combining multiple visualizations into interactive dashboards. This step aims to present multiple facets of the analysis in a single view, enabling a comprehensive storytelling approach.

#### 5. Interactivity and Filters
- Enhance user experience by capitalizing on Tableau's interactivity features. This includes adding filters, drill-down options, and other interactive elements that empower users to engage with the visualizations.

#### 6. Publish and Share
- After achieving satisfaction with the visualizations and dashboards, publish the work to Tableau Server or Tableau Public. This step facilitates sharing insights with stakeholders, embedding visualizations in various platforms, or collaborating with team members.
